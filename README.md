To recreate setup:
  1. https://github.com/NVIDIA/trt-llm-as-openai-windows/tree/release/1.0
  2. Neo4j database
  3. Any server to return jsons to frontend: Suggestion: Use a single page python bottle server

Note for self: The LLM sometimes gives random outputs or hallucinates. Ideally we have to use the largest LLM we can fit into the card.
